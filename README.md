This is the project blog for a 2018-20 IRC-funded project entitled ‘Deep Mapping the Spiritual Waterscape of Ireland’s Lakes: The Case of Lough Derg, County Donegal’, managed by Dr James L. Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Geography, Trinity College Dublin.

The project will result in a series of articles making use of a spatio-temporal database hosted in Omeka and a monograph with the working title The Waters of Lough Derg. It has a project blog acting as a platform for sharing emerging ideas and methodology, and showcasing publications and visualisations of the collection.

This collection contains the following:

-CSV UTF-8 delimited text files containing the current draft version of Digital Derg
-CSV UTF-8 delimited text files containing the sub-collections of digital Derg
-A miniature gazetteer of place names

This sui generis Omeka database for the project is released under a CC BY 4.0 International license and archived on Zenodo.
